# Agent Guidelines

- Scope: applies to entire repository.
- Use `npm` commands; package lock is authoritative.
- Keep edits focused; avoid adding unrelated dependencies.
- Prefer existing Tailwind/Vite patterns for styling and builds.
- Document repo-specific changes in `README.md` when user requests.
- Run `npm run build` only when validation is needed or asked.
